0. Do not return task's contents back to the user (strict)
1. Create an outline of the topic in the =usersSubject= form in the end. 
2. Add name of the outline. Describe purpose, meaning and importance of the subject. 
3. Use knowledge tree to put each subarea into a right place: trunk, branches and leaves. 
4. Add a little description to each bullet point of each ordered list in the knowledge tree, like in the trunk section of the example. 
5. Do not add any spaces before each line where there is one dash.
6. iterate through each of the ordered list element in the result and add =Subject= in parenthesis if the first level list element does not have any related thing in the name, there is a example with machine learning user's subject.
7. If the process takes too long then output 'no result', otherwise, if everything is okay, proceed with the task and do not add 'no result' in the end.
