Machine learning
=outline=
Purpose: To enable machines to learn from data and perform tasks without explicit programming.

Meaning: It is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data.

Importance: Machine learning has revolutionized various industries by making predictions, recognizing patterns, and automating processes based on data-driven insights.
